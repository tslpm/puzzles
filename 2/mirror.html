<p>
For most fonts, the lowercase letters <tt>b</tt> and <tt>d</tt> are mirror
images of each other, as are the letters <tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt>.
Furthermore, letters <nobr><tt>i</tt>, <tt>o</tt>, <tt>v</tt>,
<tt>w</tt>, and <tt>x</tt></nobr> are naturally mirror images of
themselves. Although other symmetries exists for certain
fonts, we consider only those specifically mentioned thus far for the
remainder of this problem.
</p>

<p>
Because of these symmetries, it is possible to encode certain words
based upon how those words would appear in the mirror.   For example
the word <tt>boxwood</tt> would appear as <tt>boowxod</tt>, and the
word <tt>ibid</tt> as <tt>bidi</tt>.   Given a particular sequence of letters, you are to determine its mirror image or to note that it
is invalid.
</p>



<p><b>Input:</b>  The input contains a series of letter sequences, one per
line, followed by a single line with the <tt>#</tt> character.
Each letter sequence consists entirely of lowercase letters.

</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each letter sequence in the input, if its mirror image is a
legitimate letter sequence based upon the given symmetries,
then output that mirror image.  If the mirror image does not form a
legitimate sequence of characters, then output the word <tt>INVALID</tt>.
