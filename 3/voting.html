<span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>A committee clerk is
good at recording votes, but not so good at counting and figuring the
outcome correctly.&nbsp; As a roll call vote
proceeds, the clerk records votes as a sequence of letters, with one
letter for every member of the committee:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Y means a yes vote<br>
N means a no vote<br>
P means present, but choosing not to vote<br>
A indicates a member who was absent from the meeting<br>
</div>
<p>
Your job is to take this recorded list of votes and determine the
outcome.
</p>
<p>
Rules:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
There must be a quorum.&nbsp; If at least half of the members were
absent, respond "need quorum".&nbsp; Otherwise votes are
counted.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are more yes than no votes, respond
"yes".&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are more no than yes votes, respond
"no".&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are the same number of yes and no votes,
respond "tie". <br>
<p><b>Input:</b>  The input contains of a series of votes, one per
line, followed by a single line with the <tt>#</tt>
character.
Each vote consists entirely of the uppercase letters discussed
above.&nbsp; Each vote will contain at least two letters and no more
than 70 letters.
</p><p><b>Output:</b> For each vote, the output is one line with the correct choice "need quorum", "yes", "no" or "tie".<br>
